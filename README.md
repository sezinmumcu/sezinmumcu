## About Me
🎓 Psychology graduate from Leiden University with specialization in statistics & data science  
📊 Transforming complex datasets into meaningful insights and actionable business recommendations  
🌍 Based in Leiden, The Netherlands  
🔍 Passionate about uncovering patterns in data and communicating results effectively

## Data Storytelling Approach
I believe effective data analysis goes beyond statistics—it's about crafting narratives that drive decision-making:

- 📈 **End-to-End Analysis**: From data cleaning to insights generation and visualization
- 🔄 **Model Evaluation**: Implementing multiple models to find optimal solutions
- 🎨 **Visual Communication**: Creating intuitive visualizations that reveal hidden patterns
- 📝 **Business Impact**: Translating analytical results into actionable strategies
